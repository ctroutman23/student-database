# student-database

I created a small database of students in the `mydb.db` file. The **students** table is the only table currently in the database, but I plan to add more tables in the near future.

The primary purpose of this project is for me to implement my knowledge of sql and to collaborate with other data analysts looking to do the same.

If you'd like to collaborate with me on this repository, then simply follow the instructions below:

## Set Up
1. Clone down the repository
2. Open in VS Code
3. Make sure you have the reccomended VS Code Extensions installed
    - SQLite (alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite)
    - SQLite3 Editor (yy0931.vscode-sqlite3-editor)

If you need to install these extensions, make sure you reload your window in VS Code after the installations are complete. 
  1. Open the command pallette in VS Code **command - shift - p**
  2. Type 'reload' and select **Developer: Reload Window**

## Usage
Once you have completed the set up steps, you can see the work I've done so far.
  - The `mydb.db` file contains the students table.
    - You can add students to this table directly through the GUI in VS Code through  the sqlite3 editor extension.
    - You can also add more tables to the database by creating them in the `mysql.sql` file.
  - At this point, the `mysql.sql` file contains the code I used to create the students table and several queries I created to filter for specific results.
  - To run each query and view the results:
    1. Highlight the query or queries you want to see
    2. Right click
    3. Select **Run Selected Query**
    4. The results should appear in a new window titled **SQLite**

## Collaboration
If you'd like to contribute to this project, that would be awesome! Here's some ideas to help. But of course feel free to come up with more.

  - Add more records to the **students** table
  - Write more queries for the **students** table. The more complex the better! Just make sure to identify the goal of each query in the comments.
  - Create a new table(s) and add it to the database `mydb.db`
  - Write queries that involve joining multiple tables within the database (joins)
  - Utilize SQL window functions

However you can contribute will be greatly appreciated. Just **submit a pull request** once you're done.
